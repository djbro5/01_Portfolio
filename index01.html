    <hr>
    <p><img src="assets01\images01\me.jpg" alt="Me" style="width:170px;margin-right:15px;">
    I enrolled in University Of Adelaide coding bootcamp, not to change career or get a job, but to learn web full stack development as part of a skill required by my startup company to 
    design and develop an IoT tracking product for a particular market segment. I could employ a developer but, since the coding bootcamp is a fast-track 26-week course, I decided to learn 
    the skill myself.<br>
    I have always been keenly interested in web design including full stack web development and the new technologies that go with it. Upon completion, I will probably do some freelance work
    and have six paying clients already waiting! Also have a good graphic designer to partner with.<br>
    My professional background is engineering (biomedical and rehabilitation) with graduate business studies (Innovation and Entrepreneurship). The business studies taught me that, to be 
    successful, it is essential to grasp marketing and how powerful it is in the 'understanding and manipulation of humans in a commercial environment'! And doesn't social media 
    (digital marketing) do a good job of that!<br>
    In recent years, I have diversified into establishing and managing (with my wife) a successful business of local manufacture and supplier of corporate uniform to a national airline!
    The business currently has no website landing page... but it will soon once I have learned how to design one!!
